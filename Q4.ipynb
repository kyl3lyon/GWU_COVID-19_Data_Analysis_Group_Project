By the first quarter of 2021, we see that the south and west region received relatively less doses, with 1.7 times the difference (350k ~ 600k). Moving on to the second quarter, the south region still receive relatively less doses and also the middle part of the US, with also 1.7 times the difference (700k ~ 1.2m). By the end of 2021, the distribution of doses become nearly the same across every states (1.4m ~ 1.8m)."
